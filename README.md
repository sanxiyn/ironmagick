# IronMagick

This project implements [RMagick](http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/) API using
[System.Drawing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.aspx)
namespace of .NET to be used with IronRuby.

Compare [RMagick4J](http://kenai.com/projects/rmagick4j) which does
the same for JRuby.

Current development is focused on running
[Gruff](http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff/) which depends on RMagick.
You are welcomed to contribute parts of RMagick you need, but is not
excercised by Gruff.

Thanks!
